## Connection

Connect RICOH THETA to computer with Wi-Fi in access point (AP) mode.
The THETA will be at 192.168.1.1.

Ideally, you have two network interfaces.  For example, an
inexpensive Wi-Fi USB adapter will work fine.

The network interface for your Internet router or hotspot must
not be a 192.168.1.1 or will interfere with the THETA IP address.

The password is the numbers only.  In the example above, the password
is 10010104.
